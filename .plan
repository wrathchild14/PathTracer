**focused rendering - smart ray generation with deep learning
* will extract bounding boxes which (for spheres) can calculate the area of pixels in the image needed for focusing

post processing:
* autoencoder denoiser network - https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/publications/dnn_denoise_author.pdf
* diffusion models

PT changes:
* add image class for image data handling

naive method:
* mark spheres which are closest to the camera to send out more samples to them
