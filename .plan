**focused rendering - smart ray generation with deep learning
object detection:
* ViT - vision transfomer
    * dino-like architecture - self supervised
* yolov5-like architecture to recognize spheres in the picture, then pick the largest one
* yolov5-like architecture to recognize custom mesh (can be cube) in the picture

* will extract bounding boxes which (for spheres) can calculate the area of pixels in the image needed for focusing

post processing:
* denoiser network - https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/publications/dnn_denoise_author.pdf


PT changes:
* add image class for image data handling
